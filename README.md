Hello!

This site can help you with the savings calculation if you decide to replace regular incadescent lamps on fluorescent lamps.

Here you can see Costs and Savings development and the first day when saving actually starts.

In the left frame you can see 3 groups of parameters which you can define to make the calculation more precise:

1.Rates definition:
* Location. At the moment you can choose only USA (by default) or specific State. You can upload below updated file with Rates.
* Hours per day. Average lamps usage per day.
* Interval in days. Period for analyzing.

2.Incadescent Bulb:
* Power of using incadescent bulbs.
* Quantity of using incadescent bulbs.
* Average Price (by default 1$)
* Average Lifetime (by default 1000h)

3.Analogue Fluorescent Bulb:
* Average Price (by default 10$)
* Average Lifetime (by default 10000h)

Savings calculation based on the following formula:
Savings = (Power * Avg hours per day * Days * Rate  + Price) * Lamps Quantity

Assumptions: 
* Lamps Quantity depends on the chosen lifetime.
* Fluorescent Bulbs are taking 5 times less energy.

If you want you can change type of charts.

Hopefully this site will be useful and give for someone one more reason to start using fluorescent bulbs in order to save natural resources.

Thank you!
